  description: Viola heads a research team at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization.
    She investigates the self-organization of spreading dynamics in the brain to understand the emergence of living computation.
    With the outbreak of COVID-19, she adapted these mathematical approaches to infer and predict the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and to investigate mitigation strategies.
    Viola is board member of the Campus Institute for Data Science and Fellow of the Schiemann Kolleg.

  description: By day, Alex is a data scientist trying to implement Bayesian models at the French firm Societe.com.
    By night, he doesn’t (yet) fight crime, but he’s an open-source enthusiast and core contributor to the python packages PyMC and ArviZ.
    Alex is also the creator and host of the only podcast dedicated to Bayesian statistics, “Learning Bayesian Statistics”.
    Every fortnight, he interviews practitioners of all fields about why and how they use Bayesian statistics.
    He also loves Nutella a bit too much, but he doesn’t like talking about it -- he prefers eating it.
