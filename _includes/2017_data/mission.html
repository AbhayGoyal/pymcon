                    We believe that the PyMC project is more than just a codebase.
                    It is also a community that is interested not only in statistical methods and code,
                    but also in sharing knowledge and helping others - whether they be Bayesian veterans or new to the world of open source.
                    The purpose of this conference is to elevate our community,
                    just as we actively maintain and better our code repositories project. 
                </p>
                <h3>The goals of the conference are to:</h3>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Create a space and time for community members to meet each other and interact</p></li>
                    <li><p>Record and organize the expertise and experience around PyMC</p></li>
                    <li><p>Help folks find ways to contribute to PyMC, authentic to themselves</p></li>
                </ul>
