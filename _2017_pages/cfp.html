      <h2 class="first">Key Dates</h2>
      <p>Deadline for CFP: September 4th, 2020. Anywhere on Earth.</p>
      <p>Date of speaker content submission: TBD. Likely first week of October 2020.</p>

      <h2 class="first">Conference Summary</h2>
      <p>
      PyMCon 2020 is an asynchronous-first conference.
      All accepted speakers will submit a video with their presentation ahead of time.
      </p>

      <p>
      We are looking for folks like you to share your cool tricks, best practices,
      general knowledge, or model build methods with the Bayesian community.
      Presentations should have some relevance to the PyMC community, more details on
      what we look for in a presentation and how to propose one can be found below.
      </p>

      <p>
      All presentations will be pre-recorded and will be shared on the PyMC discourse in
      late October for the async component. We are also planning a synchronous component
      for early November. Further details are below as well.
      </p>

      <p>
      This conference will have two tracks:
      <ul>
        <li>a "Conjugate Model" track for folks just getting started out,</li>
        <li>and a "No U Turn Sampler" track for folks that are already  warmed up with
          Bayesian Methods.</li>
      </ul>

      First time speakers are welcomed and encouraged. Please feel free to reach
      out with questions about submitting a proposal, you can find us at the <a href="https://discourse.pymc.io/t/pymcon-2020-call-for-proposals-is-open/5567">PyMC discourse</a>.  </p>

      <p>
      There are three presentation formats:
      <dl>
        <dt><a class="reference internal" href="#talks">Talks</a></dt>
        <dd>30-40 min video about PyMC tricks, best practices, related library, etc.</dd>
        <dt><a class="reference internal" href="#tutorials">Tutorials</a></dt>
        <dd>60 min video + engaging material diving into a spedific PyMC related topic.</dd>
        <dt><a class="reference internal" href="#lbam">Let's build a model</a></dt>
        <dd>60 min video documenting how to build an example model using PyMC.</dd>
      </dl>
      </p>

      <h2 class="first">Conference Specifics</h2>
      <p class=normal-text>
        PyMCon 2020 is an asynchronous-first conference,
        that will include a both an async discussion and synchronous discussions.
        All presentations have three primary components:
           <ul>
            <li>A prerecorded video</li>
            <li>A 1-week forum discussion</li>
            <li>A synchronous time for folks to meet!</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <h3 class="first">Self-recording (T-3 Weeks prior to conference)</h3>
      <p class=normal-text><b>Put on a shirt. Pants optional. Hit record </b> </br>
        You as a speaker will be giving a presentation as you would at any other conference,
        except that you will be recording it ahead of time.
        PyMCon will collect the videos and post them on online about a week prior to the conference day.
        </p>
      <h3 class="first">Async Discussion (T-1 Week prior to conference)</h3>
      <p class=normal-text><b>Put on a shirt. Pants optional. Answer questions on discourse </b> </br>
        All presentations will be posted onto the PyMC discourse so the community as a whole
        can engage, read, and comment, all at their own pace.
        As a speaker, this allows your presentation to be seen by a much wider audience
        than if just presented once and have a richer conversation with your viewers.
      </p>

      <h3 class="first">Synchronous Conference Day (T-0 Liftoff!)</h3>

      <p class=normal-text><b>Dress your best and meet all the folks </b> </br>
        This day will look more like the open source conferences you've loved in the past.
        As an attendee this day will likely consist of Lightning Talks, Birds of a Feather discussion
        sessions, and discussion sessions from speakers. We'd like to have speaker available answer
        questions live for folks in sessions as well.
        The exact timing is TBD, but we plan to find time zones that are convenient for everyone
        and may end up doing two synchronous sessions in the same calendar day to meet our
        global community's localities.
      </p>
      <h2 class="first">Presentation formats</h2>
      <div id="talks" class="section">
      <h3 class="first">Talks</h3>
      <p class=normal-text>
        Talks will consist of a 30 to 40 minutes video. As pre-recorded videos, talks are
        expected to be polished and crisp.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the content shown in the video (slides, code, plots...) and language should
        be professional, comprehensible and follow PyMCon code of conduct.
        A successful talk does not have to be about a novel, cutting-edge technology
        topic but should be distinctive and have the ability to keep the attention of
        the audience. We will provide a platform for audience discussions and Q&A.
        Accepted speakers are asked to be online the day of for at least one session of
        Q&A to answer questions live, which is 20 minutes long;
        of course, they are free to participate in the discussions with the audience
        outside of this Q&A session as well.
      </p>
      </div>

      <div id="tutorials" class="section">
      <h3 class="first">Tutorials</h3>
      <p class=normal-text>
        Tutorials are dedicated to introducing, promoting, and advancing specific
        techniques/practices in computational Bayesian statistics with PyMC. They should
        cover a topic more in depth than a traditional talk.
        Tutorials will consist of a 60 minutes video and extra material for attendees to
        engage and experiment with the contents of the tutorial.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tutorial facilitators are responsible for preparing interactive and carefully
        designed materials, including hands-on exercises that help reinforce the concepts
        discussed in their topics. We will provide the platform (most likely Slack) in
        which tutorial facilitators can communicate and share materials with their
        audience prior to the conference.
      </p>
      </div>

      <div id="lbam" class="section">
      <h3 class="first">Let's Build a Model</h3>
      <p class=normal-text>
        We are excited to introduce a new conference presentation format called "Let’s
        Build a Model" (LBAM). While sharing some characteristics with tutorials,
        LBAM talks aim to showcase the exciting (and sometimes messy!) nature of
        Bayesian modeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a LBAM talk, the presenter should first establish a specific modeling goal
        and then proceed to build that Bayesian model from scratch using PyMC (e.g.,
        in a Jupyter notebook). Like tutorial, LBAM videos should be 60 minutes long.
      </p>
      <p>
        We know Bayesian modeling is a considerably involved process and can therefore be daunting to new users.
        With LBAM talks, we aim to address this problem by encouraging speakers to be as thorough as possible,
        while making sure to include relevant “tricks of the trade” that they find useful in their own experience.
      </p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="first">What we are looking for in a proposal</h2>
      <p>
        So many are people are doing so many cools things we don't want to restrict ideas
        with a "strong prior". However we will consider proposals based on the following
        principles
      </p>

      <p class=normal-text><b>Originality</b> </br>
        Proposals should that originality in some dimension whether that be in
        presentation approach, visuals, math, whatever! Be creative and show it off!
        Proposals that are already publicly available or similar to published videos have
        a low probability of being accepted.
      </p>

      <p class=normal-text><b>Relevance to PyMC community</b> </br>
        This doesn't mean you do need to give a talk on PyMC3/4. But it does
        mean think about the diverse and expansive PyMC and how your presentation
        would elevate them.
      </p>

      <p class=normal-text><b>We're not looking for typos!</b> </br>
        We recognize that folks come from a variety of backgrounds and English isn't
        always the first language. We will not be judging the proposals for typos
        and for accepted speakers who would like language assistance we'll have folks
        who can help.
      </p>

      <h3 class="first">What to include in a proposal</h3>
      <p>
        Submitting a proposal to PyMCon will require the follwing information about the
        speaker:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Contact email.</b> It will be confidential and only accessible to PyMCon
            organizers</li>
          <li><b>Name and short bio.</b> They will be included with the presentation when
            advertizing it and in the PyMC discourse async discussion. The bio should
          not be longer than 100 words.</li>
          <li><b>Prior speaking experience.</b> No prior speaking experience is required
          and it won't be considered when reviewing submissions. It will help us allocate
          resources during the content recording phase.</li>
          <li><b>GMT offset</b> It will not be taken into account when reviewing the
            proposal. It will be used to decide the final time and timetable of PyMCon</li>
          <li><b>Any extra comments.</b> PyMCon aims to be an inclusive conference and we
          are ready to cover any specific need we may have missed.</li>
        </ul>

        Moreover, all accepted speakers will be required to sign up at
        <a href="https://discourse.pymc.io/">PyMC discourse</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      The proposal itself should include the following information:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Presentation format.</b> As explained above, one of Talk, Tutorial or
          Let's build a model</li>
          <li><b>Intended track.</b> One of "Conjugate Model" or "No U Turn Sampler"</li>
          <li><b>Short description</b> It will be used to advertize the talk in the website
          </li>
          <li><b>Abstract</b> The abstract should be a detailed description of what will
            be covered in the presentation. It should provide information about the
            audience: "What specific concepts will be needed to follow the presentation?
            Will libraries other than PyMC3 and its dependencies be used?" and a detailed
            outline of the presentation: its objective and key takeaways, and the general
            structure of the presentation. Include links to relevant source code, articles,
            videos or other information that add context to your proposal.
          </li>
        </ul>
