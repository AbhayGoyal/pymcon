      <h2 class="first">Key Dates</h2>
      <p>Deadline for CFP: September 4th Anywhere on Earth</p>
      <p>Date of final submission: TBD Likely first week of October</p>

      <h2 class="first">Format</h2>
      <p>
      PyMCon 2020 is asynchronous first conferences. All contributors will be submitted a video or code
      ahead of time. which will be posted in a TBD place (probably Youtube)
      </p>

      <h2 class="first">What we are looking for</h2>
      <p>
        We are looking for folks like you to share your cool tricks, best practices,
        and general knowledge with the Bayesian community. This conference will have two
        tracks, a "Conjugate Model" track for folks just getting started out, and "No U turn Sampler"
        track for folks that are already tuned and well warmed up with Bayesian Methods.
        (Track names  and puns subject to change).
      </p>

      <p>
          There are three formats we're looking for specifically
      </p>

      <h3 class="first">Talks</h3>
      <p class=normal-text>
        Traditional talks are 30 to 40 minutes in length and should be pre-recorded. If accepted, speakers are asked to submit a video file that contains the recording of their talk, which will be uploaded and viewed prior to the conference.
        As pre-recorded videos, talks are expected to be polished and crisp. Slide contents and language should be professional and comprehendible. A successful talk does not have to be about a novel, cutting-edge technology topic but should be distinctive and have the ability to keep the attention of the audience.
        We will provide a platform for audience discussions and Q&A. Accepted speakers are asked to be online the day of for at least one session of Q&A to answer questions live, which is 20 minutes long; of course, they are free to participate in the discussions with the audience outside of this Q&A session as well.

      </p>

      <h3 class="first">Tutorials</h3>
      <p class=normal-text>
        Tutorials are dedicated to introducing, promoting, and advancing specific techniques/practices in computational Bayesian statistics with PyMC. Each tutorial, also to be recorded, is one hour long and should cover a topic more in depth than a traditional talk. Tutorial facilitators are responsible for preparing interactive and carefully designed materials, including hands-on exercises that help reinforce the concepts discussed in their topics.
        We will provide the platform (most likely Slack) in which tutorial facilitators can communicate and share materials with their audience prior to the conference.
      </p>

      <h3 class="first">Lets Build a Model</h3>
      <p class=normal-text>
        We are excited to introduce a new conference talk format called Let’s Build a Model (LBAM). While sharing many common characteristics with tutorials, LBAM talks aim to showcase the exciting (and sometimes messy!) nature of Bayesian modeling.
        In a LBAM talk, the presenter should first establish a specific modeling goal and then proceed to build that Bayesian model from scratch using PyMC (e.g., in a Jupyter notebook). A LBAM talk is also a pre-recorded video and should be one hour long.
        We know Bayeisan modeling is a considerably involved process and can therefore be daunting to new users. With LBAM talks, we aim to address this problem by encouraging presenters to be as thorough as possible, while making sure to include relevant “tricks of the trade” that they find useful in their own experience.
      </p>

      <h2 class="first">What we look for in a submission</h2>
      <p class = "normal-text">
        More to come
      </p>

      <h2 class="first">Format of conference</h2>
      <p class=normal-text>
        PyMCon 2020 is asynchronous first conferences, that will include a both an async discussion
        and synchronous discussions. There are three primary components.
           <ul>
            <li>A prerecorded talk, tutorial, or "Let's build a model"</li>
            <li>A 1 week forum discussion</li>
            <li>A synchronous time for folks to meet!</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <h3 class="first">Self-recording (T-3 Weeks prior to conference)</h3>
      <p class=normal-text><b>Put on a shirt. Pants optional. Hit record </b> </br>
        You as a speaker will be giving a talk or tutorials as you would at any other conference,
        except that you will be recording it ahead of time. PyMCon will collect the recording
        and post them on online about a week prior to the conference day.
        </p>
      <h3 class="first">Async Discussion (T-1 Week prior to conference)</h3>
      <p class=normal-text><b>Put on a shirt. Pants optional. Answer questions on discourse </b> </br>
        All submissions will be posted onto the PyMC discourse so the community as a whole
        can engage, read, and talk, all at their own pace. As a speaker this allows your submission
        to be seen by a much wider audience than if just presented once, and have a richer
        conversation your viewers.
      </p>

      <h3 class="first">Synchronous Conference Day (T-0 Liftoff!)</h3>

      <p class=normal-text><b>Dress your best and meet all the folks </b> </br>
        This day that looks more like the open source conferences you've loved in the past.
        As an attendee this day will consist of Lightning Talks, Birds of a Feather discussion
        sessions, discussion sessions from speakers. As a speaker we'll ask that you
        be able to answer questions live for folks that are on the call. The exact
        timing is TBD but we plan to find timezones that are convenient for everyone
        and may end up doing two synchronous sessions in the same calendar day to
        to meet our global communities localities.
