  topic: A Novel Bayesian Model to Fit Spectrophotometric Data of Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes
  proposal_summary: Understanding how the most massive galaxies rapidly formed and quenched when Universe was only $\sim$3 billion years old is one of the major challenges of extragalactic astronomy. In this talk, I will discuss how to improve our understanding of massive galaxy formation by combining the spectro-photometric observations of the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes for strong gravitationally lensed galaxies. In particular, a multi-level regression model is built that can fit all multi-wavelength data for a range of instruments within a hierarchical Bayesian framework to constrain the properties of the stellar populations. The details of how this model is implemented using \texttt{pymc3}, as well as the estimates of the posteriors of all parameters of interest and nuisance parameters will be highlighted.

This probabilistic model combines the intuitive concepts of high school chemistry with the computer's ability to store and reason about large datasets. We use our model in the lab, where it guides a robot chemist towards \"interesting\" experiments that might lead to the discovery of new reactions.

  topic: The MLDA multilevel sampler in PyMC3
  proposal_summary: This presentation will give you the chance to know more about PyMC3’s new multilevel MCMC sampler, MLDA, and help you use it in practice. MLDA exploits multilevel model hierarchies to improve sampling efficiency compared to standard methods, especially when working with high-dimensional problems where gradients are not available. We will present a step-by-step guide on how to use MLDA within PyMC3, go through its various features and also present some advanced use cases, e.g. employing multilevel PDE-based models written in FEniCS and using adaptive error correction to correct model bias between different levels.

  topic: calibr8: Going beyond linear ranges with non-linear calibration curves and multilevel modeling
  proposal_summary: You just coded up a beautiful model and dummy prediction looks great. Now comes the data, but wait: the units don't match! And to make matters worse, the correlation between model variable and measurement readout is non-linear and heteroscedastic! Sounds familiar? non-linear calibration to the rescue! With `calibr8`, we present a statistical framework and corresponding open source Python package that solves non-linear calibration and likelihood functions for modeling. From a laboratory automation and systems biology perspective, the advantage of non-linear calibration with `calibr8` is two-fold: For lab scientists doing (high-throughput) experiments, `calibr8` facilitates more intuitive uncertainty quantification and makes every-day data analysis more robust, automatable and Bayesian. From a modeling perspective, non-linear _error models_ are essential components of realistic Bayesian process models, and are key to accurately describe the nastiest step of the data-generating process. In this talk, we will take you step-by-step through the data-generating process of an automated bioassay and demonstrate how its non-linearities are modeled with `calibr8`. We will show how `calibr8` can make your life easier - and of course more Bayesian - even if you don't always go all the way to a process model. Finally, we will show how non-linear error models and multi-level modeling with `PyMC3` enable you to get more information out of heterogeneous regression analyses. Join us for the talk and discussion to learn about building Bayesian models for bioassays and dive into the fascinatingly frightening world of non-linear measurement errors!
