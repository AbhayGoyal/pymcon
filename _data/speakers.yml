  description: By day, Alex is a data scientist trying to implement Bayesian models at the French firm Societe.com.
    By night, he doesn’t (yet) fight crime, but he’s an open-source enthusiast and core contributor to the python packages PyMC and ArviZ.
    Alex is also the creator and host of the only podcast dedicated to Bayesian statistics, “Learning Bayesian Statistics”.
    Every fortnight, he interviews practitioners of all fields about why and how they use Bayesian statistics.
    He also loves Nutella a bit too much, but he doesn’t like talking about it -- he prefers eating it.
