  topic: Trying to keep an open yet skeptical mind by contributing to open source software+statistics
  description: 'Oriol is a research assistant on Bayesian model selection on generalized linear models
    at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona). His work there with David Rossell is available as part
    of the R/C++ package mombf. He is passionate about Bayesian statistics, open science and
    reproducibility. He is an ArviZ core contributor and tries to contribute to the PyData ecosystem
    and the greater Bayesian community. He has just started a blog on Bayesian statistics and open
    source software at <a href="https://oriolabril.github.io/oriol_unraveled/">oriolabril.github.io</a>'

  topic: International Development. Statistics/data science for international development. Sounds more confident than he is.
  description: "As Director, Sid provides technical and thought leadership within the data science team. He is responsible for growing the data science capability within IDinsight, and oversees the design and development of all data science projects.

Prior to joining IDinsight, Sid worked as a data scientist at QuantumBlack, McKinsey‚Äôs advanced analytics arm; Coles, a supermarket chain in Australia; and the Center for International Development at Harvard. He worked in public health for the Clinton Health Access Initiative where he helped countries scale access to diagnostics, and developed global forecasts to inform pricing negotiations for sub-Saharan Africa. Sid enjoys using a wide range of statistical methods to inform policy, and recently discovered that he is a closet Bayesian. His previous projects have involved large-scale predictive analytics, optimisation, and Bayesian inference.

Sid holds a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering from the University of Melbourne, and an MPA in International Development (MPA/ID) from Harvard Kennedy School. He speaks English, Hindi, and Telugu.

Sid was born in New Delhi and did a large share of his growing up in Melbourne. He has lived and worked in a number of developing countries, including Uganda, Ghana, India, and Papua New Guinea. He now lives in Boston with his wife and spends his evenings chasing after his two toddlers."
