We value the participation of each member of the PyMC community and want all attendees to
have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to
show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all
conference events, whether officially sponsored by PyMC or not.
</p>
<p>
To make clear what is expected, all delegates, speakers, exhibitors and volunteers at
PyMCon event are required to conform to the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct. Organizers will
enforce this code throughout the event.
</p>
<p>
We reproduce here certain portions of the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct that are specifically
relevant to PyMCon. We encourage all PyMCon participants to review the complete
Code of Conduct.
</p>

<h2 class="first">The Shorter Version</h2>
<p class="normal-text">
Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that
harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes and language are not appropriate for
PyMCon.
</p>
<p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of
many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate.
</p>
<p>PyMCon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of
participants in any form.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
